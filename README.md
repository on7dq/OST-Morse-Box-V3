# OST-Morse-Box-V3
A number of new functions and a complete rewrite of the control program

Still compatible with the original hardware, both the basic version , or the expanded DG version.
You will need to update the Arduino firmware to version 3.00, then enjoy the completely rewritten Windows Control program V3.00

More info to follow soon, manual, help file etc.
