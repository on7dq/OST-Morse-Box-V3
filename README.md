# OST-Morse-Box-V3
A number of new functions and a complete rewrite of the control program, now even including a "Game" to test your progress.
Check the manual or the HELP file.*

This version is still compatible with the original hardware, both the basic version, or the expanded DG version.
You will need to update the Arduino firmware to version 3.00, then enjoy the completely rewritten Windows Control program V3.00

 (* If you don't see anything in the HELP file, open it's properties and tick the "Unblock" box)
